    "In our journey through our numerical analysis course, we've witnessed your progress and effort to improve your coding abilities and learn how to 'digitize' math problems with numerical recipes. As we delve deeper into the subject matter, it's time to take the next steps in the learning process.\n",

Providing feedback to your peers is a valuable learning experience, as it not only allows you to critically assess others' work but also provides insights into your own approach and understanding of the material. Constructive feedback fosters a culture of collaboration and mutual support, enriching our collective learning journey.\n",

Embrace this opportunity with an open mind and a willingness to explore. Stepping stones are placed along the way to help you reach the end.

    "\n",
    "**Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sea levels are being monitored globally, to track how the surface of the Earth's waters changes with time. The data are collected via two main ways: \n",
    "* coastal stations which measure the sea level relative to the ground locally via tide gauges https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/tide-gauge.html.\n",
    "* satellites that measure the sea surface over most of the planet via altimetry https://sealevel.nasa.gov/faq/19/how-do-satellites-measure-sea-level-change/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sattelites provide higher accuracy and coverage of the planet's surface, but only have gathered data for a short time period. Coastal stations have been gathering data for many decades, but have poorer quality. In this assignment we use data from coastal stations because of their longer time-span. \n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing decades-long data from both sources, scientists have found that the global-average sea level is rising, lately at an accelerating pace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to collect and analyse data from coastal stations in locations of your choice to see how the sea levels have been changing in different parts of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more at: \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task overview:**\n",
    "* Problem 1 guides you through using data from an online database to measure and document decades-long trends in the sea levels from different coastal stations. Your results should be uploaded so that the entire class can access them for Part 3.\n",
